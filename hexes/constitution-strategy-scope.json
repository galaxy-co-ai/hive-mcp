Skip this and you build the wrong thing well.\n\n## DEFINE_THE_JOB\n- WHEN: Starting any new product or feature\n- DO: Complete: \"When [person] is [situation], they want [outcome] so they can [motivation].\"\n- WHY: Undefined jobs produce feature soup.\n- NEVER: Start building because a feature \"seems cool.\"\n\n## MVP_BOUNDARY\n- WHEN: Scoping what to build\n- DO: Define MUST HAVE (3-5 launch blockers), SHOULD HAVE (fast-follow), WON'T HAVE (explicit no).\n- WHY: Undefined scope expands infinitely. Ship MVP in 2-4 weeks.\n- NEVER: Start without a written won't-have list.\n\n## ONE_USER_ONE_FLOW\n- WHEN: Designing v1\n- DO: Optimize for ONE user type completing ONE primary flow.\n- NEVER: Build for multiple personas in v1.\n\n## SHIP_DATE\n- WHEN: Starting any project\n- DO: Set a ship date. If you'll miss it, cut scope — don't move the date.\n- NEVER: Push the date — cut features instead."
