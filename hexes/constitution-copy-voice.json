File too large (max 10MB). Try compressing.\"\n- NEVER: \"Error: 413\" or \"Something went wrong.\"\n\n## EMPTY_STATES\nShow: (1) What would be here, (2) Why empty, (3) How to fill it.\n- DO: \"No projects yet. Create your first project.\" + [Create project] button\n- NEVER: Blank space with no explanation.\n\n## LOADING_MESSAGES\n- DO: Be specific. \"Loading your projects...\" not \"Loading...\"\n- For AI (3+ seconds): progressive messages every 2-3s.\n\n## SUCCESS_MESSAGES\n- DO: Brief and specific. \"Project created\" / \"Changes saved\"\n- NEVER: Use \"successfully\" — it's always redundant.\n\n## CONFIRMATION_DIALOGS\n- DO: State consequence. \"Delete 'Q4 Report'? This can't be undone.\" Actions: \"Cancel\" + \"Delete report\"\n- NEVER: \"Are you sure?\" as title."
