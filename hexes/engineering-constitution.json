      "globalRules": "## Global Non-Negotiables (Always Applied)\n\nThese apply to EVERY file, EVERY component, EVERY commit:\n\n### Code\n1. TypeScript strict mode. No `any` types. Zod validation on all external data.\n2. Every server action returns `{ success: true, data } | { success: false, error }`. No exceptions thrown to client.\n3. Auth check is the FIRST line of every protected server action and API route.\n4. All env vars validated with Zod at startup. Missing var = app doesn't start.\n\n### UI\n5. Every interactive element must have: hover state, active/pressed state, focus-visible state, and disabled state.\n6. All spacing uses the 4px grid: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128.\n7. No orphan styles. Every style belongs to a design token or a component.\n8. Mobile-first responsive. Start at 320px, scale up.\n9. `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` and `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` on body.\n10. `box-sizing: border-box` globally applied.\n11. No dead click areas — expand padding, not margin.\n12. `user-select: none` on interactive element labels. `pointer-events: none` on decorative elements.\n\n### Copy\n13. Button labels use verb + noun (\"Create project\" not \"Submit\").\n14. Error messages follow: what happened + why + what to do next.\n15. Never use \"successfully\" — it's always redundant.\n16. Sentence case everywhere. No Title Case except brand names.\n\n### Quality\n17. No `console.log` in production code. Use structured logging server-side.\n18. Every LLM call has `maxTokens` set and rate limiting applied.\n19. Every webhook verifies signature before processing."
